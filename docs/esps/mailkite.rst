MailKite
========

Anymail integrates Django with the `MailKite`_ developer email platform, using
their `send API`_.

MailKite is *inbound-first*: as well as sending transactional mail over a single
JSON API, it also *receives* email — a parsed message body and an authentication
verdict, delivered together as one signed webhook. That makes it a good fit for
support inboxes, reply-to-thread flows, and agent mailboxes without wiring a
second inbound vendor. This backend implements the transactional send API.

Installation
------------

MailKite's send API is a plain JSON-over-HTTPS API, so the MailKite backend has no
ESP-specific dependencies beyond what Anymail already requires. Just install Anymail:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install django-anymail

(In other words, there is no ``[mailkite]`` extra to install.)


Settings
--------

.. rubric:: EMAIL_BACKEND

To use Anymail's MailKite backend, set:

  .. code-block:: python

      EMAIL_BACKEND = "anymail.backends.mailkite.EmailBackend"

in your settings.py.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILKITE_API_KEY

.. rubric:: MAILKITE_API_KEY

Required. A MailKite API key (an ``mk_live_…`` token), which you can create in the
`MailKite dashboard`_. The sender address (``from``) must be on a domain whose
ownership you've verified in MailKite.

Prefer a **domain-scoped** key, which can only send for the one domain you issue it
for. (An account-level key can send for every verified domain on the account, and is
required only for account-wide APIs like retrieving a message.)

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "MAILKITE_API_KEY": "<your MailKite API key>",
      }

Anymail will also look for ``MAILKITE_API_KEY`` at the root of the settings file
if neither ``ANYMAIL["MAILKITE_API_KEY"]`` nor ``ANYMAIL_MAILKITE_API_KEY`` is set.

.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILKITE_API_URL

.. rubric:: MAILKITE_API_URL

The base url for calling the MailKite API.

The default is ``MAILKITE_API_URL = "https://api.mailkite.dev/"``
(It's unlikely you would need to change this.)


.. _mailkite-esp-extra:

esp_extra support
-----------------

To use MailKite features not directly supported by Anymail, you can set a message's
:attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.esp_extra` to a `dict` that will be merged
into the JSON body sent to MailKite's `send API`_.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        message.esp_extra = {
            # thread a reply under a previous Message-Id
            'inReplyTo': '<a1b2c3@mail.example.com>',
        }

(You can also set ``"esp_extra"`` in Anymail's
:ref:`global send defaults <send-defaults>` to apply it to all messages.)


Limitations and quirks
----------------------

MailKite does not (yet) support a few Anymail additions through the send endpoint.
Anymail normally raises an :exc:`~anymail.exceptions.AnymailUnsupportedFeature`
error when you try to send a message using a feature MailKite can't express. You
can tell Anymail to suppress these errors and send anyway — see
:ref:`unsupported-features`.

**Scheduled sending**
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.send_at` is supported: a future time
  parks the message with MailKite's scheduler (the API responds with an
  ``ssnd_…`` id and Anymail reports a ``queued`` status); a past or omitted
  time sends immediately.

**No inline attachments**
  The send API has no Content-ID field, so inline images
  (:func:`~anymail.message.attach_inline_image`) are not supported through Anymail.
  Attach them as regular attachments instead.

**Batch sending / per-recipient merge**
  Setting :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data` or
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_headers` switches to MailKite's
  batch-send endpoint: each ``to`` recipient gets an **individual message**
  showing only their own address, personalized with their merge values
  (per-recipient values win over
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_global_data` and extra headers,
  key by key). Each recipient gets their own
  ``message_id`` in :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.anymail_status`,
  and a batch can partially succeed — a suppressed address reports status
  ``rejected`` and other failures ``failed``, without raising an error.
  Three restrictions: MailKite allows at most **50 recipients per batch
  message**, ``cc``/``bcc`` can't be combined with a batch send (each
  message goes to exactly one recipient), and the batch API accepts no
  metadata (see below).

**No tags**
  MailKite has no tags field and no ESP-side analytics to segment with one, so
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.tags` is not supported.

**Metadata is not in webhook payloads, and not available for batch sends**
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.metadata` is stored with the message and
  returned by MailKite's get message API, but is *not* included in tracking webhook
  payloads. To use it in a tracking webhook handler, call the get message API with
  the event's ``message_id`` (this needs an account-level API key).

  MailKite's batch send API has no metadata field, so neither
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.metadata` nor
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_metadata` is supported in a
  batch send.


.. _MailKite tracking events: https://mailkite.dev/docs

.. _mailkite-tracking:

Status tracking webhooks
------------------------

MailKite can POST signed engagement events for your outbound mail —
``email.sent``, ``email.bounced``, ``email.complained``, ``email.opened``
and ``email.clicked``.

By default these are delivered to your domain's **single webhook URL**, the same
one that receives inbound mail (engagement events are opted in per domain). Use
Anymail's *combined* webhook URL for that setup, which handles both kinds of
event:

    :samp:`https://{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailkite/`

MailKite can alternatively POST engagement events to a **separate** tracking URL,
keeping them off your inbound handler. Set it with the ``setTrackingWebhook`` API
(or ``mailkite webhook set-tracking`` in the CLI), and use Anymail's paired URLs:

    :samp:`https://{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailkite/tracking/`
    (with :samp:`https://{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailkite/inbound/`
    as the domain's webhook)

Either way, deliveries are signed identically and verified with the same
``MAILKITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` setting (see :ref:`below <mailkite-inbound>`).
Anymail normalizes the events to
:class:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent`: bounces carry the DSN
diagnostic in :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.mta_response`
(reject reason ``bounced``), complaints report reject reason ``spam``,
clicks carry :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.click_url`, and
opens/clicks include the user agent. One caveat: bounce and complaint events
originate from provider notifications and carry a null ``message_id`` —
key on :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.recipient` for those
(the full event, including MailKite's machine/scanner flags on opens and
clicks, is in :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.esp_event`).
``email.delivered`` is reserved by MailKite for a future release and is
already mapped, so it will work when the ESP starts emitting it.

.. _MailKite inbound webhook: https://mailkite.dev/docs


.. _mailkite-inbound:

Inbound webhook
---------------

MailKite is inbound-first: mail sent to any address on a verified domain is
parsed and delivered to your webhook as JSON — decoded subject and bodies,
attachments, and the SPF/DKIM/DMARC/spam verdicts computed at MailKite's
receiving edge — so there is no raw MIME to parse on your end.

To use Anymail's normalized :ref:`inbound <inbound>` handling, set your
MailKite domain's webhook URL (in the `MailKite dashboard`_, or via the
``setWebhook`` API) to:

    :samp:`https://{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailkite/inbound/`

If that same webhook also delivers tracking events (MailKite's default when you
opt a domain into them), use the combined URL instead — see
:ref:`status tracking <mailkite-tracking>`:

    :samp:`https://{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailkite/`

MailKite signs every delivery with an ``X-MailKite-Signature`` header
(HMAC-SHA256). Anymail requires the signing secret to verify it:

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "MAILKITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET": "<your webhook signing secret>",
      }

You can read the secret from your domain's webhook settings in the MailKite
dashboard (or the ``getWebhookSecret`` API). Requests with a missing, invalid,
or expired signature are rejected with HTTP 400; MailKite's automatic retries
re-sign each attempt.

Anymail exposes MailKite's parsed fields on the
:class:`~anymail.inbound.AnymailInboundMessage`: envelope sender and
recipient, from/to (with display names), subject, text and html bodies, and
attachments (fetched from MailKite's signed attachment URLs, or decoded
inline on zero-retention and at-rest-encrypted domains).
:attr:`~anymail.inbound.AnymailInboundMessage.spam_detected` reflects
MailKite's spam verdict. The complete event — including the ``auth`` block
(SPF/DKIM/DMARC results) and ``threadId`` (pass it back as ``esp_extra
inReplyTo`` to reply in-thread) — is available in the event's
:attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailInboundEvent.esp_event`.

**Open and click tracking**
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.track_opens` and
  :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.track_clicks` are supported as
  per-message overrides of the sending domain's tracking defaults (HTML
  messages only). With click tracking on, MailKite rewrites links to a
  signed redirect that records the click and forwards the reader to the
  original URL; ``mailto:``/``tel:`` links and in-page anchors are never
  rewritten, and clicks from security scanners are flagged so they can be
  excluded from click counts.
